        <h3>Specifications</h3>

        <p>I am learing iOS app development now, because I have a MacBook to work
           on right now. This might change in the near future. It might be useful
           at some point to be able to make an app work for both Android and iOS.
           For this eventuality I want to have seen at least the basics. For the
           moment I don't inted to do more than just this one course.
           <br/>
