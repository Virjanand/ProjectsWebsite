  <!--Specifications -->
        <h3>Specifications</h3>

        <p>Learning HTML and CSS will allow me to understand and debug websites
           created in, for example, Mendix, but also to create them from the
           ground up. Especially the CSS part will be useful when creating larger
           web applications. Eventually I want to include learning HTML5 games in
           this project.
